# RestaurantsBillingSystem

This is a basic restaurants billing system in Assembly Language as part of my lab project.

It is consisted of Starter Menu that gives following options:

- To see Menu and Prices
- To see Deals and Offers
- To place an Order
- To Reset the bill [Cancel the order]
- To Exit [Terminate Program]

## Menu and Prices

It only prints the complete Menu with prices to help our customers in selection.

## Deals and Offers
